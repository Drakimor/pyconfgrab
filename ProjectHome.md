pyconfgrab came from frustration with the limited nature of some other programs I worked with to manage config files. They were very specific and not very extensible.

The goal is to make a very clean and adaptable way to deal with config files and check them into version control, or just keep a copy local.

Thus far it has an ssh, scp and ftp module which plug into RANCID, but I am hoping to expand to have it's own framework very soon.

Please keep in mind I am not a programmer, I am an IT guy, so if you ARE a programmer your help would be appreciated in making this happen.

Credit to 23andMe for allowing me work time to do this and then upload it.
